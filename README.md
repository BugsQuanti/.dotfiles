🌟 My Dotfiles Repository 🌟

This repository contains all the configuration files (dotfiles) that I use to customize my development environment. Originally, these dotfiles were tailored for Debian Unstable, but they are now primarily optimized for Arch Linux. 🐧

After a fresh installation of Arch Linux, I simply clone this repository into my home directory and use the stow script to create symbolic links. This makes it easy to manage and apply my configurations seamlessly. 🔧 Contributions

Some of the configurations in this repository are inspired by other public dotfiles that I found useful. I’ve integrated them here to enhance my setup and share them with you! 💡

Feel free to explore and customize them for your own needs!
